### Digidesign-001-pci aka Digi001

Its an old audio interface, does Not have Alsa drivers,
but works, and has decent sound.

they Only way to install in Windows7x32 or XPsp3 32-Bit:

Download ProTools 6.4 LE installer,

Digi001 has ASIO drivers v6.1.1, v6.4 and v6.7 maybe 6,9

Only v6.4 work,
needs to run in Compatibility mode WinXPsp3,

Only works in Windows 32-Bit,
havent Tested ReactOS, but should work ok.

Only intel 975x boards work, i tested a X58, tweaked almost everything, 
problem is related to ACPI, AHCI / MPS Tables v1.4 v1.1

Q6600 CPU works ok,

the idea of installing Windows7 is to use Vienna Ensemble Pro 5 or 5 or FXMax Teleport
